                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>My gaming store was founded back in 1873, my great great grand father founded this store which started out as a gaming store, for card games. 20 years after opening his doors gangsters took over the store
                , and after that times were good and the store made a lot of profits which at some point would tranfer over to selling board games and such. After all the gangers went to prison my great grand father took over
                and made some changes, such as starting to sell childrens toys to the store. this went on for a while until the year 2000 when I took over the  store. I took all the children's toys and threw them all in the dumpster.
                I then re stocked the store with gaming merchandise, such as plushies, video games, as well as snack food and drinks. </p>
